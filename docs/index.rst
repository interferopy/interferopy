Welcome to Interferopy's documentation!
***************************************

A Python library of common tasks used in the observational radio/mm interferometry data analysis.

The package was developed to aid in the studies of the interstellar medium in high-redshift quasar host galaxies using emission lines, as well as to create publication quality plots.

The package has been tested and used for ALMA, NOEMA, VLA and JCMT (limited) data.

To get started, checkout the :doc:`pages/install` page.
