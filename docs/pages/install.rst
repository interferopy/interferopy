Installation
============

Download the code, enter the interferopy folder and run

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

Or, alternatively, install directly from the repository with

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/interferopy/interferopy

Interferopy runs in python3 and uses the following libraries: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``, ``astropy`` and ``tqdm`` (for nice progress bars). The required packages will be downloaded and installed automatically when installing the package with ``pip`` or ``python install``.
